## 🧭 Before you start

## ✅ Pull Request Checklist

To help us review your contribution smoothly, please ensure your PR follows these guidelines:

1. 💬 Discussion started beforehand for larger changes ([GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/hirokazu-kobayashi-koba-hiro/idp-server/discussions))
2. 🐛 A related GitHub Issue is created with a good description
3. 🎯 One feature or fix per PR
4. 📆 PR is a single commit (`git rebase`, not `git merge`). See below for how to do this.
5. 📘 Commit message follows format and links to issue (e.g., `Closes #123`)
6. 🔍 Only modify code related to your change
7. 🧪 Includes unit/integration tests where applicable
8. 📓 Includes documentation updates if applicable

### 🔧 How to squash commits into one using rebase

If you have multiple commits in your PR, please squash them into a single commit before submitting:

```bash
git rebase -i origin/main
```

In the interactive screen:

* Keep `pick` for the first commit
* Change the rest to `squash` or `s`
* Save and edit the commit message if needed

Then force-push your branch:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

---

## 🥪 Testing

* Write tests in the style of existing tests
* Do not introduce new mocking or testing frameworks unless discussed
* Tests should run with `./gradlew test` and pass CI

---

## 📚 Documentation

* Please update the [Docusaurus documentation](https://your-docusaurus-site.com) if your change affects public API or behavior.
* Include example configurations or API payloads where possible.

---

## 📅 Commit message format

Use the following format for your commits:

```text
Add support for XYZ feature

Detailed explanation if needed.

Closes #123
```

You can use multiple `-m` flags to create multiline messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add support for XYZ feature" -m "Closes #123"
```
