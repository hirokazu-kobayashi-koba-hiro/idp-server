## What is `idp-server`?

`idp-server` is not just an identity provider —  
**it is a full-featured, extensible identity framework** designed for modern, multi-tenant SaaS environments.  
It supports OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, CIBA, FAPI, and verifiable credentials.

Designed with a clear separation of concerns, `idp-server` is built as a **framework-agnostic core** —  
capable of integrating into any application stack while keeping protocol logic, authentication flows, and session
control modular and customizable.

### Key Features

- Framework-independent core logic
- Fully pluggable authentication and authorization flows
- Dynamic, per-tenant configuration
- Built-in support for session control, hooks, and federation
- Production-ready support for multi-tenancy and database isolation

Yes — **idp-server is a framework**.  
It empowers developers to build enterprise-grade identity platforms with flexibility, structure, and control.

## Getting Started

This section helps you quickly set up and launch the IdP server in your local environment.

Whether you're testing OpenID Connect flows etc, or benchmarking performance —
you’ll be up and running in just a few steps.

### requirements

- Java 21 or later
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18 later（for e2e）

### preparation

* set up generate api-key and api-secret

```shell
./init.sh
```

※ fix your configuration

```shell
export IDP_SERVER_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8080/
export IDP_SERVER_API_KEY=xxx
export IDP_SERVER_API_SECRET=xxx
export ENCRYPTION_KEY=xxx
export ENV=local or develop or ...

docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f idp-server
```

* init table

```shell
./gradlew flywayClean flywayMigrate
```

### setup configuration

```shell
./setup.sh
```

```shell
./sample-config/test-data.sh \
-e "local" \
-u ito.ichiro \
-p successUserCode001 \
-t 67e7eae6-62b0-4500-9eff-87459f63fc66 \
-b http://localhost:8080 \
-c clientSecretPost \
-s clientSecretPostPassword1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890 \
-d false
 ```

```shell
./sample-config/test-tenant-data.sh \
-e "local" \
-u ito.ichiro \
-p successUserCode001 \
-t 67e7eae6-62b0-4500-9eff-87459f63fc66 \
-b http://localhost:8080 \
-c clientSecretPost \
-s clientSecretPostPassword1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890 \
-n 1e68932e-ed4a-43e7-b412-460665e42df3 \
-l clientSecretPost \
-m clientSecretPostPassword1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890 \
-d false
 ```

### e2e

Once the setup configuration is complete, you can immediately run E2E tests to verify that your IdP server is functioning correctly.

#### Test Structure
The test suite is organized into three categories:

* 📘 scenario/: Realistic user and system behavior — e.g., user registration, SSO login, CIBA flow, MFA registration.
* 📕 spec/: Specification compliance tests based on OpenID Connect, FAPI, JARM, and Verifiable Credentials.
* 🐒 monkey/: Fault injection and edge-case validation — intentionally invalid sequences, parameters, or protocol violations.

#### run

```shell
cd e2e
npm install
npm test
```

### performance-test

* Load testing powered by k6
* Covers CIBA, Token, and Multi-tenant login scenarios
* Supports horizontal scalability testing
* ➡️ See [performance-test/README.md](./performance-test/README.md) for full usage

### 🗂 System Architecture (Container Level)

This diagram illustrates the container-level architecture of the idp-server, a modular and extensible Identity Provider
built with Java and React.

* The Frontend is implemented with React / Next.js and handles user interactions for login, consent.
* The Backend API is built with Spring Boot and exposes REST endpoints for OIDC/OAuth flows, client management, tenant
  operations, and hook configuration.
* The IdP Engine encapsulates the core logic for authentication, authorization, grant handling, and token issuance.
* Authentication Interactors are pluggable components that support various methods such as Password, Email OTP,
  WebAuthn (Passkey), and Legacy system login.
* SecurityEventHook Executors trigger external actions such as Slack notifications and generic Webhooks based on
  security events and authentication lifecycle.
* Federatable OIDC Providers enable enterprise federation with external identity providers using OIDC or SAML protocols.
* SSF Notifier streams security events (Shared Signal Framework) to relying parties for audit or incident response.
* PostgreSQL serves as the primary database, with support for MySQL.
* The architecture supports multi-tenant deployments and allows per-tenant databaseType and configuration control.
* Redis or Memory Cache is optionally used for caching ServerConfig, ClientConfig, and Grant data to improve performance
  and scalability.

This architecture is designed to deliver high security, customization flexibility, and developer-friendly extensibility,
making it suitable for real-world enterprise deployments and Verifiable Credential issuance.
