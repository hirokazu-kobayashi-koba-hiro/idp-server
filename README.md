## Overview

This project is a flexible and extensible Identity Provider (IdP) implementation that fully supports the OAuth 2.0 and
OpenID Connect specifications.

It can be used as:

- A **standalone server** for managing authentication and authorization flows out of the box
- A **Java library** that can be embedded into your own applications to add OAuth2/OIDC functionality programmatically

Built with modularity and customization in mind, it provides robust APIs for handling users, clients, grants, MFA, and
hooks, while remaining lightweight and easy to integrate into any Java-based ecosystem.

### 🗂 System Architecture (Container Level)

This diagram illustrates the container-level architecture of the idp-server, a modular and extensible Identity Provider built with Java and React.

* The Frontend is implemented with React / Next.js and handles user interactions for login, consent.
* The Backend API is built with Spring Boot and exposes REST endpoints for OIDC/OAuth flows, client management, tenant operations, and hook configuration.
* The IdP Engine encapsulates the core logic for authentication, authorization, grant handling, and token issuance.
* Authentication Interactors are pluggable components that support various methods such as Password, Email OTP, WebAuthn (Passkey), and Legacy system login.
* SecurityEventHook Executors trigger external actions such as Slack notifications and generic Webhooks based on security events and authentication lifecycle.
* Federatable OIDC Providers enable enterprise federation with external identity providers using OIDC or SAML protocols.
* SSF Notifier streams security events (Shared Signal Framework) to relying parties for audit or incident response.
* PostgreSQL serves as the primary database, with support for MySQL.
* The architecture supports multi-tenant deployments and allows per-tenant databaseType and configuration control.
* Redis or Memory Cache is optionally used for caching ServerConfig, ClientConfig, and Grant data to improve performance and scalability.

This architecture is designed to deliver high security, customization flexibility, and developer-friendly extensibility, making it suitable for real-world enterprise deployments and Verifiable Credential issuance.


## 🔥 Technical Highlights

### ⚙️ Modular & Composable Architecture
Each core capability—Authorization, Authentication, MFA, Consent, VC Issuance, Hooks—is implemented as independent, composable modules.  
You can disable or replace modules without breaking the entire system.

> 🧩 Easy to maintain, easy to embed.

### 🔌 Plug-and-Play
Built-in extensibility via interfaces 

1. `AuthenticationInteractor`
2. `SecurityEventHookExecutor`
3. `OAuthProtocol` etc

Swap out mechanisms with minimal code.
