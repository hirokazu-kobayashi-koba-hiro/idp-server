# Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to **idp-server**, an open-source Identity Provider (IdP) engine designed for modern authentication and authorization needs.

## What is idp-server?

`idp-server` is a lightweight, extensible, and specification-compliant Identity Provider that supports:

- OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749)
- OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- FAPI (Financial-grade API)
- Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Verifiable Credentials (VC)
- Federation with external IdPs (OIDC / SAML)

It is built for developers who need full control, customization, and easy integration into existing systems.

## Key Goals

- ✅ **Comprehensive Spec Coverage**: Full support for OAuth2, OIDC, and FAPI profiles.
- 🔌 **Extensible**: Clean modular design with interfaces for MFA, federation, logging, and more.
- 🏢 **Enterprise-Ready**: Multi-tenancy, security events, and audit trails are built-in.
- ⚡ **Performance-Oriented**: Minimal dependencies, efficient caching, and scalable architecture.
- 🛠️ **Self-Hosted & Open**: Your data, your control.

## Use Cases

- Custom IdP for B2B SaaS platforms
- Secure authentication layer for enterprise services
- OIDC adapter for legacy identity systems
- Issuer of Verifiable Credentials under decentralized identity models
