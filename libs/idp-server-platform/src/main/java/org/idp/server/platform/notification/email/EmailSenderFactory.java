/**
 * Factory interface for creating EmailSender instances with dependency injection support. This
 * interface enables EmailSender implementations to access dependencies from the DI container, such
 * as OAuthAuthorizationResolvers for OAuth token caching.
 *
 * <p>Usage Guidelines:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>‚úÖ Recommended: Use Factory pattern for new EmailSender implementations
 *   <li>üîÑ Migration: Convert existing direct SPI implementations to use this factory
 *   <li>‚ùå Deprecated: Direct SPI instantiation without dependency injection
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Example implementation:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyEmailSenderFactory implements EmailSenderFactory {
 *   @Override
 *   public EmailSender create(ApplicationComponentDependencyContainer container) {
 *     OAuthAuthorizationResolvers resolvers = container.resolve(OAuthAuthorizationResolvers.class);
 *     return new MyEmailSender(resolvers);
 *   }
 *
 *   @Override
 *   public String type() {
 *     return "my_email_sender";
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
