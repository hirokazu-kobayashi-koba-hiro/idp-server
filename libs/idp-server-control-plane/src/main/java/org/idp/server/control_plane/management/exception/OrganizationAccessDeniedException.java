/**
 * Exception thrown when organization-level access control verification fails.
 *
 * <p>This exception is thrown by {@link
 * org.idp.server.control_plane.organization.access.OrganizationAccessVerifier} when any of the
 * 4-step verification process fails:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Organization membership verification
 *   <li>Tenant access verification
 *   <li>Organization-tenant relationship verification
 *   <li>Required permissions verification
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link PermissionDeniedException} which indicates insufficient permissions,
 * OrganizationAccessDeniedException indicates access control failures related to organization
 * membership, tenant assignment, or organization-tenant relationships.
