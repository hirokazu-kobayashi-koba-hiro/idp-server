/**
 * 7.1. Access Token Types
 *
 * <p>The access token type provides the client with the information required to successfully
 * utilize the access token to make a protected resource request (along with type-specific
 * attributes). The client MUST NOT use an access token if it does not understand the token type.
 *
 * <p>For example, the "bearer" token type defined in [RFC6750] is utilized by simply including the
 * access token string in the request:
 *
 * <p>GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
 *
 * <p>while the "mac" token type defined in [OAuth-HTTP-MAC] is utilized by issuing a Message
 * Authentication Code (MAC) key together with the access token that is used to sign certain
 * components of the HTTP requests:
 *
 * <p>GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Authorization: MAC id="h480djs93hd8",
 * nonce="274312:dj83hs9s", mac="kDZvddkndxvhGRXZhvuDjEWhGeE="
 *
 * <p>The above examples are provided for illustration purposes only. Developers are advised to
 * consult the [RFC6750] and [OAuth-HTTP-MAC] specifications before use.
 *
 * <p>Each access token type definition specifies the additional attributes (if any) sent to the
 * client together with the "access_token" response parameter. It also defines the HTTP
 * authentication method used to include the access token when making a protected resource request.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-7.1">7.1. Access Token Types</a>
